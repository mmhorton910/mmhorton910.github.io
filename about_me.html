  <h3>Trip to Ireland</h3>
  <p>Last week I went to Ireland for the first time with my mom, my sister, and her girlfriend. 
    We spent most of the trip in Dublin, but we did spend one day in Galway. The trip was very 
    fun and I would love to go back to Ireland one day!</p>

  <h3>Favorite Restaurant</h3>
  <a href="https://opium.ie/" target="_blank"> Visit Opium in Dublin if you like Thai food! </a> This is some of the best food I had 
  on my trip to Ireland and the best Thai food I've ever had. They have a passion fruit tart for dessert that I haven't stopped thinking about 
  since I had it.

  <h3>Favorite Food</h3>

  &nbsp; My current favorite food (it changes all the time) is Thai red curry. I like to get mine with chicken and serve 
  it with a side of jasmine rice. I've never tried to make any kind of &nbsp; Thai food before, but I like to cook so I'd love 
  to try one day!
